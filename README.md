## Introduction

The "Wonder Car" is a remarkable three-wheel vehicle designed to accomplish various tasks with a combination of precise motion control, object manipulation, and obstacle detection. It utilizes gear motors, hall sensors, a servo motor, and IR sensors to achieve its versatile capabilities.

## Features

- **Motion Control:** The vehicle employs two gear motors with hall sensors for accurate and smooth motion, allowing controlled movement in different directions.

- **Object Manipulation:** Equipped with a servo motor, the "Wonder Car" can grasp and hold objects, enabling it to perform tasks like picking up and placing items.

- **Obstacle Detection:** IR sensors at the front of the vehicle detect obstacles in its path, allowing the "Wonder Car" to autonomously navigate around obstructions.
